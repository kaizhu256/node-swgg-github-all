GitHub provides several timeline resources in [Atom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)) format. The Feeds API lists all the feeds available to the authenticated user:

- **Timeline**: The GitHub global public timeline

- **User**: The public timeline for any user, using [URI template](https://developer.github.com/v3/#hypermedia)

- **Current user public**: The public timeline for the authenticated user

- **Current user**: The private timeline for the authenticated user

- **Current user actor**: The private timeline for activity created by the authenticated user

- **Current user organizations**: The private timeline for the organizations the authenticated user is a member of.

**Note**: Private feeds are only returned when [authenticating via Basic Auth](https://developer.github.com/v3/#basic-authentication) since current feed URIs use the older, non revocable auth tokens.

**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```](https://developer.github.com/v3/#graphql-global-relay-ids) in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-12-19-graphql-node-id) for full details. To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header: ```application/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json ```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact).

The Git Database API gives you access to read and write raw Git objects to your Git database on GitHub and to list and update your references (branch heads and tags).

This basically allows you to reimplement a lot of Git functionality over our API - by creating raw objects directly into the database and updating branch references you could technically do just about anything that Git can do without having Git installed.

Git DB API functions will return a ```409 Conflict``` if the git repository for a Repository is empty or unavailable. This typically means it is being created still. Contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact) if this response status persists.

For more information on the Git object database, please read the [Git Internals](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Internals) chapter of the Pro Git book.

As an example, if you wanted to commit a change to a file in your repository, you would:

- get the current commit object

- retrieve the tree it points to

- retrieve the content of the blob object that tree has for that particular file path

- change the content somehow and post a new blob object with that new content, getting a blob SHA back

- post a new tree object with that file path pointer replaced with your new blob SHA getting a tree SHA back

- create a new commit object with the current commit SHA as the parent and the new tree SHA, getting a commit SHA back

- update the reference of your branch to point to the new commit SHA

It might seem complex, but it's actually pretty simple when you understand the model and it opens up a ton of things you could potentially do with the API.

Note that creating a tag object does not create the reference that makes a tag in Git. If you want to create an annotated tag in Git, you have to do this call to create the tag object, and then [create](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/refs/#create-a-reference) the ```refs/tags/[tag]``` reference. If you want to create a lightweight tag, you only have to [create](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/refs/#create-a-reference) the tag reference - this call would be unnecessary.

Issues use [these custom media types](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#custom-media-types). You can read more about the use of media types in the API [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/media/).

**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```](https://developer.github.com/v3/#graphql-global-relay-ids) in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-12-19-graphql-node-id) for full details. To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header: ```application/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json ```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact).

**Note**: In the past, pull requests and issues were more closely aligned than they are now. As far as the API is concerned, every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request.

This endpoint may also return pull requests in the response. If an issue is a pull request, the object will include a ```pull_request``` key.

Each type of source control system represents authors in a different way. For example, a Git commit author has a display name and an email address, but a Subversion commit author just has a username. The GitHub Importer will make the author information valid, but the author might not be correct. For example, it will change the bare Subversion username ```hubot``` into something like ```hubot &amp;lt;hubot@12341234-abab-fefe-8787-fedcba987654&amp;gt;```.

This API method and the "Map a commit author" method allow you to provide correct Git author information.

    <div class="description styleColor777"><p>Source Imports - Get commit authors.</p>
<p>Each type of source control system represents authors in a different way. For example, a Git commit author has a display name and an email address, but a Subversion commit author just has a username. The GitHub Importer will make the author information valid, but the author might not be correct. For example, it will change the bare Subversion username <code>hubot</code> into something like <code>hubot &amp;#x26;lt;hubot@12341234-abab-fefe-8787-fedcba987654&amp;#x26;gt;</code>.</p>
<p>This API method and the "Map a commit author" method allow you to provide correct Git author information.</p>

**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```](https://developer.github.com/v3/#graphql-global-relay-ids) in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-12-19-graphql-node-id) for full details. To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header: ```application/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json ```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact).

In order to create or update a user's membership with an organization, the authenticated user must be an organization owner.

- If the authenticated user is adding a member to the organization, the invited user will receive an email inviting them to the organization. The user's [membership status](https://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/members/#get-organization-membership) will be ```pending``` until they accept the invitation.

- Authenticated users can update a user's membership by passing the ```role``` parameter. If the authenticated user changes a member's role to ```admin```, the affected user will receive an email notifying them that they've been made an organization owner. If the authenticated user changes an owner's role to ```member```, no email will be sent.

**Note:** The Nested Teams API is currently available for developers to preview. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-08-30-preview-nested-teams) for full details. To access the API, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header: ```application/vnd.github.hellcat-preview+json ```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact).

To add a repository to a team or update the team's permission on a repository, the authenticated user must have admin access to the repository, and must be able to see the team. Also, the repository must be owned by the organization, or a direct fork of a repository owned by the organization.

Deprecation notice

The "Add team member" API (described below) is deprecated.

We recommend using the [Add team membership API](https://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/teams/#add-or-update-team-membership) instead. It allows you to invite new organization members to your teams.

To add a user to a team, the authenticated user must have 'admin' permissions to the team or be an owner of the organization that the team is associated with, and the user being added must already be a member of at least one other team on the same organization.

Deprecation notice

The "Get team member" API (described below) is deprecated.

We recommend using the [Get team membership API](https://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/teams/#get-team-membership) instead. It allows you to get both active and pending memberships.

To list members in a team, the team must be visible to the authenticated user.

**Note:** The Nested Teams API is currently available for developers to preview. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-08-30-preview-nested-teams) for full details. To access the API, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header: ```application/vnd.github.hellcat-preview+json ```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact).

If you pass the ```hellcat-preview``` media type, team members will include the members of child teams.

Deprecation notice

The "Remove team member" API (described below) is deprecated.

We recommend using the [Remove team membership API](https://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/teams/#remove-team-membership) instead. It allows you to remove both active and pending memberships.

To remove a user from a team, the authenticated user must have 'admin' permissions to the team or be an owner of the org that the team is associated with. NOTE: This does not delete the user, it just removes them from the team.

List organizations for the authenticated user. OAuth scope requirements

This only lists organizations that your authorization allows you to operate on in some way (e.g., you can list teams with ```read:org``` scope, you can publicize your organization membership with ```user``` scope, etc.). Therefore, this API requires at least ```user``` or ```read:org``` scope. OAuth requests with insufficient scope receive a ```403 Forbidden``` response.

**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```](https://developer.github.com/v3/#graphql-global-relay-ids) in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-12-19-graphql-node-id) for full details. To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header: ```application/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json ```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact).

The Projects API is currently available for developers to preview. During the preview period, the API may change without advance notice. Please see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-10-27-changes-to-projects-api) for full details.

The Pull Request API allows you to list, view, edit, create, and even merge pull requests. Comments on pull requests can be managed via the [Issue Comments API](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/comments/).

Pull Requests use [these custom media types](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#custom-media-types). You can read more about the use of media types in the API [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/media/).

**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```](https://developer.github.com/v3/#graphql-global-relay-ids) in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-12-19-graphql-node-id) for full details. To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header: ```application/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json ```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact).

**Note:** APIs for managing reactions are currently available for developers to preview. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-05-12-reactions-api-preview) for full details. To access the API during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header: ``` application/vnd.github.squirrel-girl-preview+json ```

**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```](https://developer.github.com/v3/#graphql-global-relay-ids) in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-12-19-graphql-node-id) for full details. To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header: ```application/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json ```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact).

**Note:** The ```topics``` property for repositories on GitHub is currently available for developers to preview. To view the ```topics``` property in calls that return repository results, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header: ```application/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json ```

**Note:** The [Repository Transfer API](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-11-09-repository-transfer-api-preview) is currently available for developers to preview. To access the API, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header: ```application/vnd.github.nightshade-preview+json ```

**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```](https://developer.github.com/v3/#graphql-global-relay-ids) in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-12-19-graphql-node-id) for full details. To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header: ```application/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json ```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact).

Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with sane defaults.

The ```ref``` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub we often deploy branches and verify them before we merge a pull request.

The ```environment``` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as ```production```, ```staging```, and ```qa```. This allows for easy tracking of which environments had deployments requested. The default environment is ```production```.

The ```auto_merge``` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If the ref is behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds, the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will return a failure response.

By default, [commit statuses](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses) for every submitted context must be in a ```success``` state. The ```required_contexts``` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be ```success```, or to specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.

The ```payload``` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.

The ```task``` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might be ```deploy:migrations``` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an application with debugging enabled.

Users with ```repo``` or ```repo_deployment``` scopes can create a deployment for a given ref:

This endpoint makes use of [a Hypermedia relation](https://developer.github.com/v3/#hypermedia) to determine which URL to access. This endpoint is provided by a URI template in [the release's API response](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#get-a-single-release). You need to use an HTTP client which supports [SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) to make calls to this endpoint.

The asset data is expected in its raw binary form, rather than JSON. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For example, you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an asset.

<p>The asset data is expected in its raw binary form, rather than JSON. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For example, you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an asset.</p>

**Note:** The ```topics``` property for repositories on GitHub is currently available for developers to preview. To view the ```topics``` property in calls that return repository results, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header: ```application/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json ```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact). About the Search API

The Search API is optimized to help you find the specific item you're looking for (e.g., a specific user, a specific file in a repository, etc.). Think of it the way you think of performing a search on Google. It's designed to help you find the one result you're looking for (or maybe the few results you're looking for). Just like searching on Google, you sometimes want to see a few pages of search results so that you can find the item that best meets your needs. To satisfy that need, the GitHub Search API provides **up to 1,000 results for each search**. Ranking search results

Unless another sort option is provided as a query parameter, results are sorted by best match, as indicated by the ```score``` field for each item returned. This is a computed value representing the relevance of an item relative to the other items in the result set. Multiple factors are combined to boost the most relevant item to the top of the result list. Rate limit

The Search API has a custom rate limit. For requests using [Basic Authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication), [OAuth](https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication), or [client ID and secret](https://developer.github.com/v3/#increasing-the-unauthenticated-rate-limit-for-oauth-applications), you can make up to 30 requests per minute. For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit allows you to make up to 10 requests per minute.

See the [rate limit documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting) for details on determining your current rate limit status. Timeouts and incomplete results

To keep the Search API fast for everyone, we limit how long any individual query can run. For queries that [exceed the time limit](https://developer.github.com/changes/2014-04-07-understanding-search-results-and-potential-timeouts/), the API returns the matches that were already found prior to the timeout, and the response has the ```incomplete_results``` property set to ```true```.

Reaching a timeout does not necessarily mean that search results are incomplete. More results might have been found, but also might not.

    <div class="resourceDescription"><p>Search.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>topics</code> property for repositories on GitHub is currently available for developers to preview. To view the <code>topics</code> property in calls that return repository results, you must provide a custom <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/media">media type</a> in the <code>Accept</code> header: <code>application/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json</code></p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact <a href="https://github.com/contact">GitHub support</a>. About the Search API</p>
<p>The Search API is optimized to help you find the specific item you're looking for (e.g., a specific user, a specific file in a repository, etc.). Think of it the way you think of performing a search on Google. It's designed to help you find the one result you're looking for (or maybe the few results you're looking for). Just like searching on Google, you sometimes want to see a few pages of search results so that you can find the item that best meets your needs. To satisfy that need, the GitHub Search API provides <strong>up to 1,000 results for each search</strong>. Ranking search results</p>
<p>Unless another sort option is provided as a query parameter, results are sorted by best match, as indicated by the <code>score</code> field for each item returned. This is a computed value representing the relevance of an item relative to the other items in the result set. Multiple factors are combined to boost the most relevant item to the top of the result list. Rate limit</p>
<p>The Search API has a custom rate limit. For requests using <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication">Basic Authentication</a>, <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication">OAuth</a>, or <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#increasing-the-unauthenticated-rate-limit-for-oauth-applications">client ID and secret</a>, you can make up to 30 requests per minute. For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit allows you to make up to 10 requests per minute.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting">rate limit documentation</a> for details on determining your current rate limit status. Timeouts and incomplete results</p>
<p>To keep the Search API fast for everyone, we limit how long any individual query can run. For queries that <a href="https://developer.github.com/changes/2014-04-07-understanding-search-results-and-potential-timeouts/">exceed the time limit</a>, the API returns the matches that were already found prior to the timeout, and the response has the <code>incomplete_results</code> property set to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>Reaching a timeout does not necessarily mean that search results are incomplete. More results might have been found, but also might not.</p>

Many of the resources on the users API provide a shortcut for getting information about the currently authenticated user. If a request URL does not include a ```:username``` parameter then the response will be for the logged in user (and you must pass [authentication information](https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication) with your request). Additional private information, such as whether a user has two-factor authentication enabled, is included when authenticated through basic auth or OAuth with the ```user``` scope.

**Note:** To help with migrating from our REST API v3 to GraphQL API v4, we're introducing a preview period to include the [GraphQL ```node_id```](https://developer.github.com/v3/#graphql-global-relay-ids) in the response for many REST API v3 resources. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-12-19-graphql-node-id) for full details. To access ```node_id``` during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media) in the ```Accept``` header: ```application/vnd.github.jean-grey-preview+json ```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact).
